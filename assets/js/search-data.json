            "content": "On May 25, 2020 George Floyd died from asphyxiation after Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. It has been a little over a month since Floyd&#39;s death and during this time, I&#39;ve been doing my best to understand and learn more about racial injustice in law enforcement. I was shocked to find just how much Black history has been overlooked in our education system. It perpetuates the pernicious idea that when Dr. King marched on Washington, a bunch of laws were changed that ended discrimination, secured equal rights, and everything was cool. . But everything wasn&#39;t cool. Racism had just evolved and people were eager to dismiss it as an antiquated idea of the past, failing to recognize how it still persists today, much of it having been built into our laws. When we look at the police in this context, officers sworn to uphold the law, it becomes evident just how broken and unfair our policing system is. . How we got here . You&#39;ve probably heard &quot;To Protect and to Serve&quot;, the motto of the LAPD. Back in the day (and probably today too) that meant protecting white people&#39;s economic interests and power, which was built on the backs of slaves. Fearing rebellions, slave patrols were created and violence was used to subdue the enslaved, preventing them from challenging their oppression. When slavery was abolished by the 13th Amendment, except as punishment for crime, the Southern states started to criminialize as many Black people as they can to return them to slavery. Black Codes were introduced that stripped them of political rights and most importantly, unfairly convicted them for crime over minor things. . Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. . Prison farms started going up and states began leasing their labor to private corporations. But the most important thing that came out of this period was the idea that Black people are criminals, something they are still suffering for today. The South turned to vigilante groups, like the Klan, to police Black people and eventually things got so awful, that millions of Black people fled north in what&#39;s known as the Great Migration. Unfortunately, things weren&#39;t much better up North because all they&#39;ve been hearing and seeing from the census data is that Black people were being incarcerated at disproportionate rates, suggesting they had a criminal problem. There were multiple race riots and Black people were arrested, attacked by white mobs while the police stood by, disarmed if they tried to defend themselves or attacked by the police themselves. The entire law enforcement and criminal justice system was just fatally flawed from the beginning. . Police violence today . Today, we are seeing the same police racism unfold in Ferguson, Baltimore and most recently, Minneapolis. Using data provided by the advocacy group Mapping Police Violence, Black Americans are killed by the police at a disproportionate rate. In a study published in PNAS, researchers found &quot;about 1 in every 1,000 black men can expect to be killed by police.&quot; For context, these are roughly the same odds as dying from a motorcycle accident. . Young Black people are at the highest risk of being killed by the police, with the most deaths happening at 25 years old. At 25, you should be living your best life instead of worrying whether you might be shot at a routine traffic stop or have the police called on you because you were wearing a mask and seemed &quot;suspicious&quot;. Again, this goes back to the idea that Black people are criminals, and are often the primary suspects in white spaces. So in response, more police are sent into Black communities to prevent using discriminatory policies like stop and frisk, broken window policing, traffic stops and arrests. If you want more examples, take a look at this list compiled by Radley Balko from the Washington Post. . So where are these deaths happening? Below I&#39;ve charted the top 25 cities in the U.S. with the most police killings from 2013 onwards. The number of people killed by the police in these large cities have mostly dropped due to reforms. For example, after the shooting of Mario Woods in San Francisco, the City reformed its policy to limit the use of force. . If we look at the police killings based on the number of households per square mile, we find that more people, especially Black people, are dying in rural and surburban areas. One reason for this disparity may be that these areas do not face the same scrutiny or pressure to reform their policing practices. It seems like only when high-profile killings happen, do people actually pay attention, which is just awful. How many more deaths are happening out there that we aren&#39;t aware of just because it hasn&#39;t generated the same level of national attention as Ferguson or Minneapolis? . In a FiveThirtyEight article, Samuel Sinyangwe (co-founder of the Mapping Police Violence project), looks at this rural-urban divide in more detail and offers several explanations for why police killings are increasing in these areas. But ultimately, he concludes that it may be difficult for smaller cities to adopt policing reforms because of the increasing political polarization between big cities and rural communities. . But I don&#39;t think more police reforms and bias training are going to fix these issues in the long-term. The number of people killed by the police have remained steady over the last few years, and we are already up to 483 deaths this year. This suggests something more significant needs to be done because whatever we&#39;ve been doing just isn&#39;t working. People have literally been pointing out cases of police violence for decades, and they have largely been ignored. In the Kerner Commission formed to explain the 159 riots that occurred in the summer of 1967, the authors wrote that the police had &quot;come to symbolize white power, white racism, and white repression&quot;. Even more impactful is the testimony of Kenneth Clark, a psychologist who&#39;s research helped shape the Brown v. Board of Education decision: . I read that report â€¦ of the 1919 riot in Chicago, and it is as if I were reading the report of the investigating committee on the Harlem riot of â€™35, the report of the investigating committee on the Harlem riot of â€™43, the report of the McCone Commission on the Watts riot. I must again in candor say to you members of this Commissionâ€”it is a kind of Alice in Wonderlandâ€”with the same moving picture re-shown over and over again, the same analysis, the same recommendations, and the same inaction. . Clark&#39;s &quot;moving picture&quot; is still playing today and we already have a Senator calling for another commission to focus on searching for solutions. ðŸ™„ . Where do we go from here? . So how do we move forward and actually effect change this time? First, we need to acknowledge that the policing system is built on the idea that Black people are criminals. We need to put an end to this incredibly damaging type of thinking. In addition, it is also time to reconsider the role of police in our communities. . One popular option you&#39;ve probably heard is to defund the police. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean completely eliminating the police though. The basic idea is to just rollback the police&#39;s role in communities, so we aren&#39;t sending them out for situations they aren&#39;t equipped to handle. It means redistributing funds for police departments towards social services that actually empower and strengthen the community. . . To do this, we need to translate what we&#39;re protesting for into law by electing officials who will actually act on reforming the criminal justice system. The good news is that some officials like AOC, who was recently reelected, is doing exactly that. More importantly, we need listen to the Black community when they speak up instead of discounting, ignoring or suppressing their voices. It doesn&#39;t take charts and data to show that these horrible things are happening if we just pay attention and listen.

You&#39;ve probably heard a lot about testing lately so I thought it&#39;d be useful to understand the science behind how it actually works. There are several types of tests out there, all of which detect different things. For example, an antibody test tells you whether you&#39;ve been previously infected based on the presence of antibodies that get generated in response to the virus. Another type of test is a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and this is what you&#39;re most likely going to get if you&#39;re being tested. . So here is how PCR works: . You start by collecting a sample, like a nose swab, which returns boogers and things. If the virus is present, some of it will probably be trapped there. | The coronavirus is a RNA virus so you need to separate the RNA from all the other biological stuff in the sample. There are a bunch of different ways you can do this and when I was in college (~5 years ago), we did a phenol-chloroform extraction. What happens is that things other than RNA gets destroyed, and in the presence of certain chemicals, stuff separates out into kind of like a 3 layer bean dip. You extract your RNA from this and end up with a tiny pellet of it. | Since you are starting out with RNA, you actually have to do reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), to first make complementary DNA (cDNA) from it. Once you have your cDNA template, then you can do regular PCR. You give it some primers (short strands of DNA to give the reaction a starting point), some basic building materials and an enzyme that assembles all this stuff together for you. | Next you have to get the temperature right. You can think of the temperature as a set of conditions your little workers demand in order to work. It has to be high enough to separate the DNA strands, cool enough so the primers can bind, and then high again for your enzyme to start building out the new strand. | The thermal cycler takes care of this for you and repeats this step multiple times. So you basically end up copying/pasting until you have way more DNA than you started out with. | The key part here is that you choose the right primers (essentially fragments of the virus) that will bind to the cDNA of your sample. In other words, if there is no COVID-19 in the sample, then you won&#39;t get anything. | . . Tip: Some charts are interactive so feel free to hover over them! . . Note: California&#8217;s stay-at-home order has no set end date and is gradually reopening on a county-by-county basis. On May 25th, the state announced some retailers were allowed to reopen, so we will mark that as the end of the stay-at-home order. . .
